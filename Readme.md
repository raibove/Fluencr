# üß† AI-Powered Influencer Discovery Engine

## What I Built

I built an AI-powered platform that helps **brands discover ideal influencers** by tapping into real-time social media data. Unlike static influencer directories, this tool dynamically finds creators who align with a brand‚Äôs **tone, values, target audience**, and **preferred content style**.

The system uses an AI agent to:
- Collect brand intent via a clean, guided interface
- Generate a natural language brief for influencer matching
- Transform that into search signals (hashtags, keywords, captions)
- Crawl Instagram in real time using **Bright Data's MCP**

This lets brands **find relevant, high-performing influencers** based on their current content‚Äînot stale bios or outdated databases.

To power the **real-time influencer discovery system**, I used Bright Data‚Äôs **MCP (Mobile Cloud Proxy)** and automation tools. Here's how it helped:

- Dynamically prioritized **posts with high engagement and recency**.

### üß≠ Access ‚Äì Platform Navigation with JS Rendering

## Performance Improvements

Traditional influencer tools rely on pre-populated databases or partner networks, which are:
- Often outdated

- Lack true intent-based matching

By using **real-time social content scraping**, I was able to:
